FaceLock – Face Detection Based Lock System
Overview

FaceLock is a real-time face recognition based lock system built using Python and OpenCV. It allows secure access by detecting and recognizing authorized users’ faces via a webcam. This system can be extended to control physical locks, doors, or computer access.

Features

Real-time face detection using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier.

Face recognition using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm.

Supports multiple authorized users.

Displays lock/unlock status visually.

Can be extended to physical access control systems.

Technologies Used

Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-python and opencv-contrib-python)

NumPy

PIL (Python Imaging Library)
